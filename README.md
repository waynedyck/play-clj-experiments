# play-clj-experiments

This repository provides code examples and experiments using [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj). The initial repositories are based on simplified code from the [play-clj-examples](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj-examples). This repository was created in an effort to document my progress in learning more about the play-clj library and Clojure in general. Hopefully it proves helpful to others as well.

## Contents

* **looping-animation** - a simple 10 frame looping animation with the graphic located at the default 0,0 location
* **looping-animation-2** - a looping animation showing a complete running cycle consisting of 30 frames from a 6 column, 5 row spritesheet
* **box2d-physics-basic** - a simple Box2D example where we define a world with gravity and two bodies; one dynamic and one static.
