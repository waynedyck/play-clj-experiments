# play-clj-experiments

This repository provides code examples and experiments using [play-clj](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj). The initial repositories are based on simplified code from the [play-clj-examples](https://github.com/oakes/play-clj-examples). This repository was created in an effort to document my progress in learning more about the play-clj library and Clojure in general. Hopefully it proves helpful to others as well.
